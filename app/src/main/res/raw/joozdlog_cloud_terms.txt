Joozdlog Cloud terms.
Please read this, it's not a lot of text.


***** FIRST OF ALL: *****


- I made this for myself. You can use it, but you don't get any rights from it.


***** How reliable is the cloud storage? *****


- YOU CANNOT RESTORE YOUR PASSWORD IF YOU LOSE IT.
I just don't see a way to safely store your data and still be able to decrypt it without your password.
Don't lose your password.

- At any time I can decide to no longer keep my server up, without notice or a reason

- I cannot help you retrieve your data if you lose your password.
Don't lose your password.

- I will probably delete accounts that are inactive for over a year.
(as they probably belong to people who forgot their password)

- The cloud service is not your backup.
It's there for convenience when you use multiple devices or get new phone.
Use the backup function in the menu.


***** Privacy, security and data collection *****


- I don't knowingly collect any data other than some diagnostics for my server.
I don't know who you are, and I cannot read your logbook.
Your IP address and logins will probably get logged somewhere though.

- I cannot access your logbook.
Everything you have on my server is encrypted with your password, that I cannot see or change.

- Communication between app and server uses SSL encryption, the same kind your bank uses.

- Maybe if my server gets hacked, somebody could intercept your flight data if you connect to it.
(Not your stored data, that is encrypted. Nor your password, that's hashed.)

- If you want to know exactly how it works, you can. This program is open source. See [about] in the menu.


***** Finally *****


- Did I mention you shouldn't lose your password?
You can if you want to, it's a free country (at least mine is) but you'll be locked out of your account.
