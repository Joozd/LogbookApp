Joozdlog Cloud terms.
Please read this, it's not a lot of text.


***** FIRST OF ALL: *****

- I made this for myself. You can use it, but you don't get any rights from it.


***** How reliable is the cloud storage? *****

- YOU CANNOT RESTORE YOUR LOGIN LINK IF YOU LOSE YOUR DEVICE.
I just don't see a way to safely store your data and still be able to decrypt it without your login credentials.
I cannot help you retrieve your data if you lose your login link.
Don't lose your login link. You can (re-)create it at any time from the Settings screen.

- At any time I can decide to no longer keep my server up, without notice or a reason

- I will probably delete accounts that are inactive for over a year.
(as they probably aren't used anymore)

- The cloud service is not your backup.
It's there for convenience when you use multiple devices or get new phone.
Use the backup function provided.


***** Privacy, security and data collection *****

- I don't knowingly collect any data other than some diagnostics for my server.
I don't know who you are, and I cannot read your logbook.
Everything you have on my server is encrypted with your password, that I cannot see or change.
Your IP address and logins will be logged with a timestamp.
Your email address might end up in a debug logfile by accident but I will remove them as soon as I am done.

- Communication between app and server uses SSL encryption, the same kind your bank uses.

- Maybe if my server gets hacked, somebody could intercept your flight data if you connect to it.
(Not your stored data or your password, those are encrypted)

- If you want to know exactly how it works, you can. This program is open source. See [about] in the menu.
