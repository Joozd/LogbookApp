Joozdlog Cloud terms.
Please read this, it's not a lot of text.


***** FIRST OF ALL: *****

- I made this for myself. You can use it, but you don't get any rights from it.


***** How reliable is the cloud storage? *****

- YOU CANNOT RESTORE YOUR LOGIN LINK IF YOU LOSE YOUR DEVICE.
Don't lose your login link.
I cannot help you access your Cloud account if you lose your login link.
Your login link can be exported from the Settings menu if you do lose it, but still have your device.

- At any time I can decide to stop providing cloud storage, without notice or a reason.

- I will probably delete accounts that are inactive for over a year.
(as they probably aren't used anymore)

- The cloud service is not your backup.
It's there for convenience when you use multiple devices or get new phone.
Use the backup function provided.


***** Privacy, security and data collection *****

- I don't knowingly collect any data other than some diagnostics for my server.
I don't know who you are, and I cannot read your logbook.
Everything you have on my server is encrypted with your password, that I cannot see or change.
Your IP address and logins will be logged with a timestamp.

- Communication between app and server uses SSL encryption, the same kind your bank uses.

- Maybe if my server gets hacked, somebody could intercept your flight data if you connect to it.
(Not your stored data or your password, those are encrypted)

- If you want to know exactly how it works, you can. This program is open source. See [about] in the menu.
