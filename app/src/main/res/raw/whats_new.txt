<H1>What's new in Joozdlog 1.2: Beaver<br><br></H1>
<p>I got rid of Cloud. It added very little extra value, but did add a LOT of extra complexity and therefore a lot of potential for bugs and undesired behavior.<br>
The useful parts, auto-backup and transferring to another device are still here, through the menu -> settings or menu -> transfer.<br>
Transfer is still experimental, meaning it will probably change in a future update in some way, but can be used to reliably transfer your flights to another device like a new phone.<br><br></p>
<p>What this means for you: You can throw away your login link. It doesn't work anymore. There is no more login.<br><br></p>

<p>For a more complete update list, see <a href = "https://github.com/Joozd/LogbookApp/blob/master/docs/ChangeLog.md">GitHub</a><br><br></p>
<p>As always: Feedback is appreciated! (menu -> feedback)</p>
